\section{Introduction.}

My first LaTeX document.

\subsection{Who I am.}

My name is Matthew Dean and I live in Cardiff, Wales, UK.

\subsubsection{More.}

\paragraph{}

Wales is a country in the United Kingdom and I have lived in Wales for all of my life.

I enjoy programming in my spare time and basic homelab adminstration. Although I study networking and further administration in college.

I do all of my programming in Vim 8+ using Linux 4.10+. Although I use my own custom \href{https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Bean6754/home/master/.vimrc}{~/.vimrc} file to suite my programming needs and ways in which I write up source code.
